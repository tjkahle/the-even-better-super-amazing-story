This is the the most amazing story of all time.  I know
a very ambitious claim to make in the first sentence of
a story but guess what it is true.  This story is so 
amazing that it must never be read by anyone with green
eyes, this is because it may overload their brain and 
their head WILL EXPLODE!!! If you have green eyes or 
have any chance in possessing a green eye gene plesase
STOP READING IMMEDIATELY.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
But anyways, the most amazing story starts off in the
most boring place with the most boring person at the 
most boring time in existance with Jeffery sitting
at his table Monday morning eating a bowl of 
cinnamon squares.

Jeffrey began to feel uneasy. These were no cinnamon squares, but instead cinnamon pentagons! He recoiled in horror at his bowl full of wicked abominations. 

Jeffrey got a knife, and cut the pentagons into squares! 

Amazed by his own quick call, Jeffrey proceeds to eat his bowl of crunchy cinnamon squares.
Filled with satisfaction, Jeffery feeds himself one spoon full after another. 
Til he found cinnamon hexagons that lie underneath but wait, there's more.
Stirred a few more times, revealed cinnamon heptagon, octagon, nonagon, decagon, and the list goes on forever.
Enraged, Jeffery smashes the bowl into pieces.
